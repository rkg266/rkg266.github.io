<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am currently pursuing a Master's in Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Control at the University of California, San Diego, with a Dual Master & Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Electrical Communication Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. My professional journey at Samsung R&D Institute, India, as a Lead Engineer and Senior Software Engineer, involved significant contributions in 5G modem commercialization and debugging automation, culminating in the deployment of crucial projects like Voice over New Radio (VoNR) and New Radio Carrier Aggregation (NR CA). My deep dive into robotics, machine learning, and software engineering has fueled my passion for building robust, scalable systems and exploring innovative AI applications in wireless, robotics, haptic interfaces and beyond. As I look to the future, I am eager to leverage my diverse skill set in a role that blends my technical expertise with my interest in cutting-edge technology, aiming to drive significant advancements in AI and system design.
